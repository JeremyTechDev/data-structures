# Data Structures by Jeremy 🧑‍💻

A collection of the most important data structures in the Computer Science world using Python 🐍. Includes my implementation of these structures and some methods to play them. Unit tests guarantee their functionality ✅.

## Folder Structure

    ├── [some_data_structure]           # Name of the data structure container in the folder
        ├── __init__.py                     # init file to handle in-folder imports
        ├── [data_structure].py             # file containing the structure logic
        └── tests.py                        # unit test for the data structure

## Test

To test a certain data structure, just run `tests.py` file with `python3` inside the structure folder:

```bash
python3 Doubly\ Linked\ List/tests.py
```
